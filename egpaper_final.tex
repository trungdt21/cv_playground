%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
   For the last few years, deep learning has proved its ability to solve complicated problems that were too cumbersome to handle. It is undeniable that key factors contributing to this sucess are mainly large-scale data and deep neural networks with billions of parameters. However, to deploy and smoothly run these enormous models on on-edge devices is not always a straightforward process. In order to overcome this, a variety of model compression and acceleration techniques have been developed. As one of the outstand techniques, knowledge distillation (KD) seeks to transfer information learned from one large model (called \textit{teacher}) to smaller one (called \textit{student}). This survey firstly gives a brief overview of what KD is then quickly investigates some of the recent work about training schemes and teacher-student architectures.
